# wp-dev
Course files from Udemy WP Developers Course with Brad Schiff.

All of this code was pushed via Git as practise using Terminal commands.

Code was all written by me following the lessons on Udemy. 

If you download or copy the code I can't guarentee it will work but bundled as a Theme using the Plugin 'All In One Migration' and installed that way you SHOULD be able to see it as a working theme. There are also working demos and links on  my personal blog www.danielmichael.net
